      "i've been a banana blossom fan for a long time but thai kitchen has taken over my top spot for best thai food in cleveland.  i love this place.  it's a hole-in-the-wall joint  that feels and smells like you're walking down a bangkok street.  i spent some time in bangkok so walking in here made me feel like i was traveling again.  it's low on \"ambiance\" but high on quality food and charm - just like the random and friendly thai vendors in the streets of bangkok.   love it.   also, this place is byob.  how freakin' awesome is that?    so, for starters my husband and i ordered the spring rolls, the fresh rolls and a bowl of tom yum soup to share.  the fresh rolls were good but  a little heavy on the lettuce.  i wouldn't order them again.  spring rolls were amazing:   light, fresh, crisp, straight from the fryer and served with a delicious tangy, spice sauce.  mmmm.  the soup was absolutely unforgettable. the flavors were layered perfectly and the soup was rich, creamy but light all at once. i first tried this dish in bangkok and it quickly became one of my favorites.  it has such a unique flavor and tastes so different from american cuisine.  for mains we ordered the pad thai and chicken prik king (spicy chicken with green beans, thai curry and thai spices).  our food came out quickly and piping hot and the cook leaned over and told me she was so jealous of my dish.  apparently it was one of her favorites and reminded her of home and she hadn't made it in such a long time so she was so glad i ordered it and that she made it special for me.  let me tell you, she made the hell out of that chicken.  my god it was delicious.  i got it at spice level 5 - which was enough to clear my sinuses but not so hot that i couldn't scarf it down while my husband watched greedily.   all in all, this was an amazing meal. everything was cooked to perfection and either met or exceeded my expectations (except the fresh rolls).   amazing food, great service and - bonus! - close to public transit (for all those byob wines i plan on carting into this place).    only negative:  this place is tiny so go with a friend, not a group of friends.  or get takeout.\n",

      "3.5 stars- very nice coffee shop! this plaza has so much to offer, glad to see there's a good place for a caffeine fix that isn't a starbucks.  went in and used $10 credit yelp deal, was helped by lady owner who was super sweet and informative about what they offered- opted for their cold-brewed tea in hazelnut, an iced latte, and a lemon dome dessert.  cold brewed coffee was amazing- they brew it for something insane, like 24 hours, and it's specially made to avoid using regular coffee plus ice, which changes the flavor of the coffee itself and is watered down as the ice melts. owner is clearly very knowledgeable and it shows in quality of product they put out. both drinks were tasty.  loved the décor and ambiance of the shop itself- especially the shelves of books to peruse. signage indicated that books are used available for sale, pricing is found in inside cover. unfortunately, the two books i was interested did not have pricing listed, indicating that they weren't for sale.  would come back for a caffiene fix in the area, love that they offer live jazz music certain days of the week. very chill place to enjoy a cup and some conversation.\n",
